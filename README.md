# ACM217-RMT

This is the final project paper for ACM217: Random Matrix Theory, taught by Prof. Joel Tropp at Caltech in Winter term (2023-2024).

The topic of this paper:

**Quantum Chaos and Random Matrix Theory: The BGS Conjecture**

This is a short review on the BGS conjecture, which links the classical integrability of the system with its quantum spectral statistics. Specifically, the spectral statistics shows consistency with RMT prediction in chaotic systems.
